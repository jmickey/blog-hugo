# Hi there!

I'm Josh. I‚Äôm an experienced technical leader in the areas of software development, cloud operations, and platform engineering. I have a proven track record of building and leading high‚Äêperforming teams, and have a strong focus on continuous improvement and knowledge sharing. I‚Äôm passionate about helping others to learn and grow, and am proud of the work I have done in mentoring and supporting others. With over a decade of experience, I have extensive knowledge of a range of technologies within the infrastructure and software engineering spaces, including:

* Kubernetes & containers
* AWS cloud administration
* Go, TypeScript, Python, and C# programming languages
* Infrastructure as Code, with extensive Terraform experience
* Continuous integration & delivery systems (CircleCI, ConcourseCI, TeamCity)
* Agile development methodologies (Scrum, Kanban)

I'm currently at [Weaveworks](https://weave.works) as a Tech Lead working on bare metal and edge Kubernetes solutions using [Firecracker MicroVMs](https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/). Previously I worked at [Snyk](https://snyk.io) solving Kubernetes security challenges and [Cond√© Nast](https://condenast.com) building a large scale global Kubernetes platform.

Occasionally I speak at tech events and meetups, you can see my various slide decks on [Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/jmickey).

Originally from Perth Australia üá¶üá∫, I now live in Cambridge UK üá¨üáß.

I love [cycling](https://www.strava.com/athletes/32368360), photography, and walking my adorable Shiba Inu #doge (see below for pics)! :dog2::heart:
